## HOW TO (RE-)USE THIS MATERIAL

This is a `.html` presentation created in `R Markdown` with `ioslides`. 

(It's been written in a [.Rmd](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) file, and we generated .html slides by 'knitting' it in Rstudio.)

You can check out the code used to make these slides at the [Workshop repo](https://github.com/CarpenPi/CollabW21-Demo-Presentation) on Github (and the [workshop materials it's based on](https://bit.ly/wallace-lab-git)), and adapt it for your own presentations if you like - I've got a MIT Licence on the repo, which means: 

*"Basically, you can do whatever you want as long as you include the original copyright and license notice in any copy of the software/source."*

## What problem does this project solve?

<div class="centered">
```{r, out.width = "700"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CarpenPi/CollabW21-Demo-Presentation/main/images/problem.png")
``` 
</div>

<div class="notes">
... slide notes ...
</div>

## What is the solution?

This is how the proposed solution should work: 

<div class="centered">
```{r, out.width = "500"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CarpenPi/docs/main/pi-network.png")
``` 
</div>

## What is the solution?

Proof of concept of git server:

```{r, out.width = "500"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CarpenPi/docs/main/gitea.png")
``` 
</div>

## What is the solution?

Set-up materials for workshop leaders:

```{r, out.width = "600"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CarpenPi/CollabW21-Demo-Presentation/main/images/traintrainers.png")
``` 

<div class="notes">
Re the traintrainers page:

It was important to us to have a visible and accessible manual for instructors hoping to use this infrastructure.

We've put together an initial workshop setup page based on the software carpentries template, and welcome further contributions!

## Future Work / End of Life

We want to develop a CI workflow to automatically update out Raspberry PI images with the last Carpentry Workshops. 

Also, we intend to incorporate Dockers to reduce the number of separate Pi's needed to maintain the infrastructure. 

Finally we want to expand the Admin web page to a fully functional Java app.
