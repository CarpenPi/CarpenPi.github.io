## Notes
No further contact with Mozambique. Andrew to followup. 

action: Everyone to look at website and give Jannetta feedback.
Abishek suggests a picture would be helpful. Colin has a potential picture with a Raspberry Pi connected to a battery pack with SSI and Carpentries logos on it. 

Three sections on website: SD card download, USB drive, mini-HPC

Welcome to Kathryn Garside, RSE from Newcastle university. Invovled with Women in HPC. Instructor on HPC Carpentry course at N8. Also to Sam Finnigan, RSE at Durham university and Carpentries instructor.

Jannetta showed mini-HPC, Raspberry Pi/Rock boards mounted on a DIN rail, power over ethernet switch. Still waiting on power over ethernet modules which will elminate the need for lots of power cables. Software mostly installed and Raspberry Pi nodes are booting over the network and there is a Slurm job manager installed. Still need to configure modules. 

AG: A possible parallel test case for the mini-HPC:

another one: https://github.com/colinsauze/pi_cluster/tree/master/demos/mpi_pi_demo
lots of things from EPCC's wee archie: https://github.com/EPCCed/wee_archie

Think about submissions to RSECon, perhaps as a hackathon. Deadline is April 25th. Could also be a workshop with more of a walkthrough. Potential idea, more realistic science demos for the minihpc. Something based around OpenFoam could be a good potential project.
