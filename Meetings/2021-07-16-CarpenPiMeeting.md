Proposal Q&A: https://docs.google.com/document/d/182MXNmMbyMlIfus_8N1OS7U9UimzPmx45_EGrGViuWI/edit?usp=sharing

Main Idea: I will create a user-friendly Zine (around 5 pages) with illustrations and instructions on how to set up a CarpenPi workshop.

Title of Zine:
CarpenPi: Teaching the Carpentries Lessons using Raspberry Pis

First work update submission due on: August 2, 2021

Final work submission due on: September 3, 2021

>What I would need: Any published guidelines on how to set up a CarpenPi workshop, your thoughts and ideas on what all we want to present in the Zine, what issues/steps to highlight

How I plan to submit: 
1. Stage 1: By August 2, I plan to submit a black and white version of the Zine. For this, I will be creating the work using paper-pencil approach first and capturing it using Adobe Capture (this will also give an idea on how it appears in print version) -- this will have images as well as wordings (the font will be how I write on paper but this will be more polished in the final submission). I might not need the entire Adobe Illustrator suite at this stage.
2. Stage 2: By September 3, I plan to submit a more polished version of the work, hopefully a colourful one. I plan to use Adobe Illustrator by this stage. 

Feefback from you all:
Each time I feel that the work has reached a presentable (even if partially) stage, I will be sharing it on slack to receive feedback from you all. I would need a detailed feedback after I submit the first version on August 2, so that I can plan the final submission properly then. If possible, I request you to schedule a meeting close to after August 2. I can manage to create the first version in 15 days time span as it is mostly paper-pencil + Adobe Capture work, however the final version will involve more creation tools, so I would need more time then. As such, it would be good to receive early feedback for stage 2 work.

>Query: 
I feel that a narrator should walk with the reader throughout the Zine. Can I adopt the useR! 2021 maRmot as the narrator of this Zine? They have made available the artwork under the CC-BY-NC-SA license: https://github.com/useRconf/visuals-2021
Any other ideas of how the narrator could look like?

## Notes (Ethan primary notetaker)

* TODOs
    * Jannetta - email Raspberry Pi for permission
        * https://www.raspberrypi.org/trademark-rules/
    * Angelique - will check with The Carpentries to see if alteration in our current way is OK
        * https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/communications/resources/logos
    * Jannetta - Do initial draft of docs for running a workshop
    * Group - Help fill in and improve the draft of the workshop docs
    * Jannetta - Arrange next meeting in ~1 month
* We need to check if we are in compliance with the Raspberry Pi and Carpentries logo policies
    * Raspberry Pi - only for the sale & use of Raspberry Pi
    * Carpentries - unaltered logos can be used, but need to ask if altering the logo is OK
* Update on server
    * No image yet, just working examples
    * Interest in also creating docker containers as well as SD card images
* Grant for producing a Zine about the project
    * Drawings & text to illustrate the idea of a CarpenPi workshop
    * $250 (USD) to support design of 5 page zine
    * Audience - Carpentries instructors who want to run a Raspberry Pi based workshop
    * Goal - Reaching places with limited internet availability
    * First submission due Aug 2nd - black and white version of zine
    * Final submission due Sept 3rd - colored version using Adobe Illustrator
    * Needs
        * Guidelines for running a Raspberry Pi based workshop
        * Early feedback before first submission
        * Detailed feedback after first submission
        * Feedback on the narrator of this Zine (maRmot or somethign else?)
    * Full guidelines haven't been developed yet
    * Plan to work on developing these in the https://github.com/CarpenPi/docs/ repository
    * Start by creating a mock setup assuming that we have functioning images
    * Do first round of feedback via Slack
    * Do second round of feedback on a call after the first submission
    * Should the narrator be the useR maRmot or something else
        * This character is associated with useR so worth considering something else
        * Benefit of having our own mascot is that it gets associated with the organization
        * Could use a different clip art animal
        * Brainstorm mascots
            * What about a Pie
            * A bird that eats a pie
            * Animals that eat Raspberries
            * A pie eating Raspberries
            * Something that eats pie/raspberries and grows throughout the zine
        * Like the idea of a bird that eats a pie and flys through the zine
    * Need the draft guidelines ASAP
        * Janetta will work on the draft this weekend
