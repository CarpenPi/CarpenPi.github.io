## Agenda
1. Welcome and Code of Conduct
2. HouseKeeping
3. Feedback for previous meeting's TO DOs:
  - Angelique: Carpentries logo
  - Jannetta: Raspberry Pi logo
  - Jannetta: Draft of howto, 
https://github.com/CarpenPi/docs/blob/main/HOWTO_Workshop_Setup.md
  - Colin: Pi OS scripts and images
5. Saranjeet's feedback and second brainstorm session

Colin has a scrip which functional. 

1. Do we want software to be downloaded from the Pi, e.g. RStudio, Anaconda? 
    - Janetta: yes should have software available they need for the workshop. Virnaliz: Content Group has scripts already to do this, e.g. for OpenRefine to support data carpentry.
    - Abhishek: have separate from main image, to save space? Colin: currently space no issue on 5gb pi. Virnaliz: all software is open source so no issue there.
2. Do we want web servers with different names? What to put where? 
    - Abhishek: prefer just having one, simpler. General agreement with this. Colin: can still have different directories under the one server to separate things.
    - Janetta can help updating instructions to use Colin's version.
3. Abhishek: need to be careful of licences, especially if making images. E.g. with internet in a box.
    - internet in a box may be too complicated to use in any case; use RaspAP + our customizations (?) instead

Saranjeet update on zine

- Has submitted first progress report. Feedback: B&W version okay, but can get extension to submit colour version.
- Missing name of the bird. Need to be careful of infringement.
  Abhishek: Lots of names in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_woodpecker_species :)
- Pages: mascot saying hi; mascot introducing carpen pi workshop; illustration of acces point and connection to learners;
- What to show on screens: typical Carpentries webpage e.g. a lesson page like this http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/; a gitea repository page; or a terminal. Try to get impression of look of the page. Can use git logo: https://git-scm.com/downloads/logos
 - On last page could have Carpentries certificate with woodpecker as participant that has completed course. In graduation gown and hat?
 - zine will be published in form we can reference, but also CC-BY so we can mix and reuse.

Other issues
- Should we have mirror of carpenpi repos on gitea? Maybe not priority initially as more for people running workshops vs learners.
- Abhishek and Janetta ready to test when people have something ready. Colin nearly has something ready to share.

Next meeting
 - Before Sept 10 would be better to give Saranjeet feedback before final submission
