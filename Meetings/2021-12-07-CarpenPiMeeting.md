## Notes

* Last month discussed and decided to joing the Carpentries Incubator program
    * Haven't started the transition yet
    * Need to open an issue to request transfer of repositories
* Colin & Jamie touched based on GitHub Actions based image builds
* Jannetta applied for SSI fellowship 
* Setting goal for pilot workshop
    * UK folks will run one first
    * Make improvements
    * UF folks then run one
    * UK workshop needs travel funding for either Jannetta or Colin
        * SSI small funds
        * Colin's fellowship
        * Society of RSE
    * Goal date - late January/early February
        * But if we don't hear back quickly on travel funds may need to push back
    * Do we want real general learners or experienced folks just to test things out?
    * Do we want to start wtih traditional Carpentries students or Carpentries instructors?
    * DECISION: Start with a 5-10 experienced people at Newcastle (potentially drawing from N8 if needed)
        * Interface testing
        * Load/stress testing
        * Try out JupyterHub on the Pi to see if that is possible
        * 1 day
