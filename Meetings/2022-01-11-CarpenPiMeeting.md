## Agenda
1. Welcome and Code of Conduct
2. HouseKeeping
3. Feedback for previous meeting's TO DOs:
    - I (Jannetta) have not had time to apply for funding since our last meeting. Should we postpone the pilot?
    - Cut git-server and Access Point: done
    - Move workshop-admin elsewhere: done
    - Move Meetings, CollabW21-Demo, and docs into Webserver & rename Webserver: Is there an easy way to move this?
    - TrainTrainers becomes a Carpentries lesson: Renamed to CarpenPi_Instructor_Onboarding: I wanted to update it before moving it to incubator.

## Notes

* Discussion of whether to postpone test session
    * Colin can use his SSI fellowship money for travel
    * COVID spike is making travel restrictive and might reduce participation
    * Set a new date (and hope things are better then)
    * Week of Feb 21 is good for Colin (already traveling to the area)
    * Jannetta will confirm that this works for her, but it looks good
    * Jannetta & Colin will start doing personal invites to get other instructors in the area to participate
    * Jannetta & Colin will discuss possible additional funding opportunities
* Repository cleanup
    * git-server and Access point have been removed
    * workshop-admin moved outside of org
    * Will copy files in from other repos
    * Need names for Webserver & web-free-data-science
        * web-free-data-science
            * offlinedatasci was discussed and voted on in October on Slack
            * Will proceed with that for now
        * Webserver
            * Switch to carpenpi-installer
    * TrainTrainers
        * Renamed to CarpenPi_Instructor_Onboarding
        * Planning to replace the current template with a blank Carpentries lesson template
        * Jannetta will then add basic information and request it's addition to the Carpentries Incubator
    * Carpenpi website
        * Do we want to keep a simple website with links to docs, downloads, etc.
        * Carpentries is still reviewing logo, name, etc, so keep them for the moment
* miniCRAN question
    * Is there another version
    * Just a very basic script, so keep working on Virnaliz's version
* etherpad
    * got this up and running on cloud
    * but no 32-bit version so older pads can't run on older Pi's, but Pi 3 & 4 would work
    * exploring possible solutions
    * What about OS version of HackMD?
        * More complicated
