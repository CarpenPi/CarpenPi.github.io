## Notes

* Janetta ran a pilot with RSE team work
    * Explained Carpentries Offline
    * Got a tower multiplug
    * Ran a script to create the Carpentries Offline image, but added a couple of things
    * Added the Raspberry PI image and angry ip
    * Everything worked except the link that was supposed to link to Gitea
    * Everyone connected to a setup PI successfully
    * Downloading Carpentries Offline image from the PI was way too slow (but this wouldn't be normal for workshops) so for teaching how to use the image will need to provide either internet based or physical download.
    * Raises concerns about downloads of large things in particular RStudio
    * Need to investigate the slow downloads
    * Could consider an external USB wifi module for for the Pi or just providing 
* Do we want to add library carpentries to offlinedatasci?
* Need to improve landing page
    * There was a version of this from the hackathon
    * Colin is trying to find this - https://github.com/carpentriesoffline/carpentriesoffline-installer/tree/pretty-webpage
* Neither proposal was accepted for RSE
* CarpentryCon proposals
    * Could do a tech session, but how to do this remotely
    * Could do a panel session, moderated to introduce key ideas and aspect of process
        * Can Ethan write up an example of what this would look like?
        * "Teaching Carpentries workshops in internet limited environments"
        * Janetta will reach out to Ethan about putting together and abstract for what this would look like
    * Could do a lesson development sprint, mostly us working on the lesson
    * Might also want a lightening talk for broader outreach
* Almost have the GitHub actions build working
    * Painful to debug given 4 hr build
    * Need to cut down miniCRAN install time
        * Start by trying RStudio Package manager
        * Could ask RStudio
* Integration with Carpentries
    * Becoming a "lesson program" means something very specific
    * "lesson programs" are the highest level (SWC, DC, LC) internal organizations
    * Requires a lot of governance infrastructure
    * Maybe we just want to be a single lesson
    * List group as a subcommunity rather than trying to become a "lesson program"
    * Governance can be built into subcommunities
    * How do we proceed with becoming a subcommunity
        * Carpentries is about to introduce this on the new website
