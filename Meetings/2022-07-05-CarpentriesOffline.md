## Notes

1. Contact Saranjeet, Heather about the sessions and perhaps about contacting people in India and Botswana
2. Jannetta is going to South Africa from 09/09/2022 to 14/11/2022. She has so far met with Verena Ras from HBABionet (at the University of Cape Town). HBABionet might become a hub for connecting to the rest of Africa as they are very active throughout the continent. Jannetta has also made contact with Kim Martin and arranged a workshop for 28-30 September, and with Martin Dreyer from North West University in Potchefstroom about a workshop in the week of 24 September.
3. Abhishek will start helping with the Onboarding lesson. Jannetta is working on episode 2 and Stuart on episode 3 as part of the lesson development workshop with Toby Hodges. Abhishek will start looking at the introduction and whatever follows on from episode 3.
4. The repository being worked on is using the new layout of Carpentries Workbench. It is currently in the CarpentriesOffline repository at https://carpentriesoffline.github.io/CarpentriesOffline_Instructor_Onboarding/01-introduction.html. Toby will eventually replace the lesson in the incubator with this version.
5. Abhishek also managed to get his hands on a Raspberry Pi and will start testing the instructions and scripts in the repository.
