## Notes
Feedback:
* Haven't contacted Saranjeet and Heather yet
* Bringing Colin up to date with Jannetta's plan for SA
* For the moment the image is 32 bit and will work on everything, but we could build both 32 and 64 bit.
* Colin fixed rfkill - the network in the emulator doesn't work well. To be discussed with Virnaliz - network failure causes script to fail and download doesn't complete
* carpentries-offline still not resolving for Jannetta. Might be the Linux setup. Fix to the configuration might help - Colin working on it.
* Build version: Install file on the pi should give time and date for image - install.log. Colin into it.
* Ask Kari about the sub-domain name.
* carpentries-offline carpentrycon talk etherpad https://pad.carpentries.org/cc2022-carpentries-offline
* Break-out session: Jannetta will put slides, presentation and a document for questions in a Google folder and share it. Questions that can be asked from attendees can be added to the document. The presentation will just be a recap of the lightning talk. Colin will email Saranjeet about joining the session.
* Virnaliz will look at scripts to retry if download fails. Perhaps add a wait after each failure.
* Colin built docker image of CarpentriesOffline for PC or cloud service.
