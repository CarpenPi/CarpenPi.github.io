## Notes

* First formal meeting in a couple of months
* Did have a meeting at RSEConf but no notes because just focused on testing
* Jannetta ran a workshop in South Africa at Stellenbosch
    * Could only connect 8 people to the Pi
    * Need to investigate this as it is probably a configuration issue
    * GitTea worked great for those 8
* Haven't heard from The Carpentries about domain names, so Janetta registered https://carpentriesoffline.org as a stop gap
    * Want to start asking people to join us and need somewhere to send them
    * Plan to redirect GH Pages site to the new domain
    * GH Pages site is currently broken
* Jannetta had a meeting with Alycia about community meetings
    * In additional to our meetings consider adding semi-regular themed community meetings
    * These would generally start with the big picture and then feature a particular discussion area
    * Then new folks could transition to development team meetings if interested
    * Will try to add 1 or 2 community discussions in the next 3 months
    * Also suggested putting a link to lightening talk in the channel
* Do we want to keep our CarpentriesOffline workspace or move over to The Carpentries broad slack
    * Could keep current for Slack for dev and use Carpentries Slack for general?
    * Could we get a second/private channel for Carpentries Slack for focused dev work?
        * Yes
    * HPC Carpentries has a channel and this is working well for them
        * They use the same channel for dev and more general
        * But they also meet more regularly and so there is less strategy/discussion happening on Slack
    * Sweet spot where a public channel has enough activity to drive participation but not overwhelm with technical discussion
        * Need disciplined plan to make regular public announcements
        * Could also thread and run a single channel
    * Concensus to move to The Carpentries Slack in a single channel
        * Try being disciplined about threading
        * Add a second channel only if needed after trying this out
    * Add a link to the CarpentryCon lightening talk as a pinned post in the channel for an introduction
* Poll for next meeting
* Digital Infrastructure incubator at Code for Science and Society
    * https://www.codeforsociety.org/incubator/accepting-proposals
    * Might be good source of funding for working group related to this project
