## Notes

* Introductions
    * New participant Andrew Gill
        * Background in mechanical engineering
        * Center for High Performance Computing at University of Cape Town
        * Actively involved in HPC adjacent training
* Offlinedatasci updates
    * polishing some things with relation to package management - feedback welcome
    * that was partly in preparation for supporting use case outside training environment; letting people easily set up for offline work, even if not in training context
    * close to providing a command line environment that will let you easily switch between CRAN/PyPI and local equivalent, like "conda activate" for working offline
* Training for Tribal colleges/Indiginous communities:
    * Growing interest in this project, to help teaching in areas with limited Internet access
    * Ethan will likely travel to meet them and provide an update from CarpentriesOffline
* Colin has a collaborator in Mozambique who might be interested
    * Does anyone have contact with instructors there
    * Andrew does
        * HPC Ecosystems
        * Did something in conjuction with Carpentries in Mozambique
        * Instructor was not Mozambique-based though
        * Internet is decent but inconsistent
* Virnaliz's friends/colleagues from Latin America are also interested
    * Already go to remote locations and give workshops
* Growing interest so need something that folks can start testing
* USB memory stick
    * Alternative to centralized Pi
    * Slax Linux - https://www.slax.org/?lang=es///en/download.php
    * Boot from USB into isolated OS
    * Still viewing this as creating the server
    * Requires an external wireless card?
    * Cheaper and easier to mail
    * Can also create an ISO to be downloaded
    * All existing code will work in this Debian based environment
        * Currently Jannetta has been trying to use isolated scripts
    * 282 MB is the base ISO size for Slax
    * Need instructions for how to setup laptops to run from USB sticks
* Jannetta is traveling to Buenos Aires for Executive Council meeting
    * Hoping to develop some connections there for testing
* Now officially registered as a Carpentries sub-community
* Jannetta did 2 Carpentries community calls
