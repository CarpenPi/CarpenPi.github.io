## Notes

### Poster
- Feedback wanted still
- Less text perhaps
- Anything else to add? bill of materials?
- Cartoon showing how the carpentries offline works.
- Action: everyone check the poster before August 8th and give a thumbs up. Make sure you're on the authors list.

### Hackathon Preparation
- Jannetta has made some worksheets  
- Things which people can look at, RockPI setup, Pixie (Raspberry Pi version). 
- Pixie fully works, but some differences with RockPI, which needs setting up. Raspberry Pi's have unique serial numbers that are used to identify them to the PXE server, RockPI doesn't so an alternative method is needed.
- Document existed for Pixie, but has been lost and needs recreating. Jannetta will try to do this before the workshop.
- Stress testing is the other activity, sTplit into network test, mini HPC and flash drive.
- Run HPC benchmarks, e.g. linpack (https://www.netlib.org/benchmark/hpl/), hpcg (https://www.hpcg-benchmark.org/). 
- Publish some visualised results
- Update the HPC Intro carpentries lesson to the miniHPC and workbench. Make our own fork of the lesson for this.
- Gitea worksheet for Carpentries Offline.
- Legacy hardware tests, bring computers (and encourage attendees to bring) old computers with old operating systems, browsers etc. Especially Windows 7/8 or old Intel Macs.
- We may need to bring additional flash drives and SD cards to get people to put carpentries offline on them. (Colin bringing Pis, Jannetta bringing USBs and SDs)
- NB: There will be an image on github in preparation for the workshop, Colin on the case! Could be good hosted elsewhere too as github has limits to file size so it has to be in multiple separate files. 
- Zenodo an option for a 'final' release prior to the workshop.
- Ncl file dropoff could be an option too!
- Adding a SHA hash to make sure that the build image is correct and uncorrupted.

### AOB
As this is the last meeting before the RSEcon, another extra meeting has been scheduled in for the 30th of September so we have a chance to get together and finalise any issues before the hackathon.

Ideas for getting registrations details:
- google forms
- git hub
Want to get an idea of skills also if poss. as well as interest.

Potential funding from the SSI to get CATS up and running on the miniHPC

This could be an option for a hackathon worksheet too, but might be a bit amitious

## Next Meeting

August 30th at 2:30 UTC (10:30 EDT, 3:30 BST, 4:30 South Africa) - https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20230830T1530&p1=1327&ah=1
