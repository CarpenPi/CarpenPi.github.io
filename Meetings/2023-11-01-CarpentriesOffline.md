## Notes

* Virnaliz working on stuff but still needs to make a pull request
* Updating Git course for Gitea
    * https://github.com/carpentriesoffline/git-novice/
    * Idea: move to subdomains of carpentriesoffline.org to prevent DNS clashes with the main carpentriesoffline.org website, git.carpentriesoffline.org.
* Sam: working on making it easy to work with Raspberry Pis by showing screen within a window in the laptop, and support for sending keystrokes from keyboard to Raspberry Pi.
    * Next steps: getting PXE working on the RockPi
* Funding for the workgroup (previous plan was to do a CarpentryConnect)
    * Jannetta talked to Shoaib from SSI, two requested proposals - hybrid or online. Jannetta prefers in-person to make it easy to test on hardware.
    * HPC best bet for in-person UK workshop
    * Workgroup proposal: https://codimd.carpentries.org/oYLClLgNR9mA_umcc4bkBg?both
    * Location: Newcastle
    * When:
    * Sam: Would be good to get to the venue the day before and setup hardware
    * Abhishek: Maybe we get a portable router to take network load off the Pi
        * Jannetta: Have two Pis - one with RaspAP
        * Sam: Old routers that can be flashed with OpenWRT.org
        * Jannetta: Support needs to be limited to a few models (routers/Pis) so we can offer proper support 
* Virnaliz: Easier to get funding once we have a MVP
    * Jannetta: Easier to stress test in person
* Virnaliz: Idea to have work meetings remotely
