## Notes

1. miniHPC debug session

## Todo
- Slurmd and slurmctld are not starting on start-up. We tried to debug that but with no success. We decided to leave that for the moment as it does start up successfully when done manually after start-up. 
- Jannetta has to restart the process of building the login node because the login node had a different version of the OS to the secondary node which is why the secondary nodes are not connecting to the controller.
