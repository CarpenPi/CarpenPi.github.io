# Setting up a Raspberry Pi

There are loads of tutorials all over the web for setting up a Raspberry Pi (RPi) computer. But, to keep everything in one central place for this project, we will describe the setup procedure here.

## Introduction

As a server a computer usually does not need a screen, keyboard or mouse attached to it. A screen and a keyboard are attached to set the server up but once that is done and the computer connects to the network, it can be accessed remotely. For this reason a server does not need to have a Graphic User Interface (GUI) installed. You will never run applications such as a web browser or a spreadsheet application on a server so there is no need for a GUI. The server will provide a text based terminal where commands can be entered to do any system administration.

To this end, the RPi Foundation makes to versions of the RPi Operating System (OS) available:
- Raspberry Pi OS Lite
- Raspberry Pi OS Full

The Lite version has no GUI and no desktop environment while the Full version has a desktop environment and recommended applications.

The RPi Foundation has now made it really easy to get a Pi computer up and running. The first thing to do is to is to create a Micro SD Card with the operating system on it. Using your desktop computer or laptop download the RPi Imager from this website: [https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/). Chances are that when you land on the website the download link for the operating system, of your computer, will be highlighted, eg.
