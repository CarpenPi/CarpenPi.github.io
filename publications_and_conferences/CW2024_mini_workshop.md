**OfflineDataSci** - A Python package for downloading and configuring common tools for teaching Carpentries workshops offline.

It often happens that we want access to our learning material without the need of access to the Internet. CarpentriesOffline is a project which aims to provide ways to do just that. As part of CarpentriesOffline the team (mostly Virnaliz Cruz) is developing OfflineDataSci which is a Python package that we use to download all lesson materials and installers for delivering Carpentries workshops. In this practical session we will cover the installation and uses of OfflineDataSci which includes the following:
- Installers for data science languages: Currently R and Python
- Installers for common data science IDEs: Currently RStudio
- Partial local mirrors of package repositories: Currently CRAN (for R) and PyPI (for Python)
- Locally browseable clones of data science teaching websites: Currently Data Carpentry and Software Carpentry
