## Mini-workshop or demo session audience

**If your session is accepted this description of the intended audience for this session will be made public on the CW24 website to help participants choose which sessions to attend. Please include any prerequisites for participants, expected prior knowledge/skills needed, if any software/tools need to be installed prior to the session, or if there is a maximum/expected number of participants if necessary.**

Anyone interested in delivering workshops using lessons from The Carpentries Curricula

## Abstract:

Managing and distributing learning materials in a teaching setting can pose challenges when internet access is limited. To address this issue, we created and are further developing the CarpentriesOffline project. As part of the CarpentriesOffline project, the team (mostly VC and EPW) is actively developing OfflineDataSci. OfflineDataSci is a Python package specifically designed for managing downloads of data science lessons materials and installers. It serves as a  resource for Carpentries workshops or for individual users who anticipate limited or no internet access. In this practical session we will cover the installation and uses of OfflineDataSci which includes the following:
- Installers for data science languages: Currently R and Python
- Installers for common data science IDEs: Currently RStudio
- Partial local mirrors of package repositories: Currently CRAN (for R) and a PyPI (for Python)
- Locally browseable clones of data science teaching websites: Currently Data Carpentry and Software Carpentry

**Please describe your session's aims and outcomes, how the session connects to the themes of CW24, how the session will run (tentative format/agenda), and how the session will be inclusive of both in-person and remote participants. If you are proposing a 60-minute session, please outline how you plan to facilitate active participant engagement/interaction with both in-person and remote participants.**

The session will be run in a typical Carpentries live coding style. We will demonstrate while participant follow along on their own computers (online or in person). We will first do a walk through of how the OfflineDataSci Python package is installed and then how it is used to deliver workshops. If time allows we will allow for discussions of how people would like to use the package and what we can do to improve it.

**Any special requirements or other information you would like to include about your proposed session?
For example, will you need extra helpers provided or a specific technical setup? Will you need use of the CW24 Sli.do?**

Attendees will need to have their own laptops with Python 3.10 or later installed and access to the Internet.

Slido might be useful.
