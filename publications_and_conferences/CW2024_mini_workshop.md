**OfflineDataSci** - A Python Package for Managing Common Data Science Tools for Carpentries Workshops or Individual Users When Limited Access to the Internet is Anticipated

Managing and distributing learning materials in a teaching setting can pose challenges when internet access is limited. To address this issue, we created and are further developing the CarpentriesOffline project. As part of the CarpentriesOffline project, the team (mostly VC and EPW) is actively developing OfflineDataSci. OfflineDataSci is a Python package specifically designed for managing downloads of data science lessons materials and installers. It serves as a  resource for Carpentries workshops or for individual users who anticipate limited or no internet access. In this practical session we will cover the installation and uses of OfflineDataSci which includes the following:
- Installers for data science languages: Currently R and Python
- Installers for common data science IDEs: Currently RStudio
- Partial local mirrors of package repositories: Currently CRAN (for R) and a PyPI (for Python)
- Locally browseable clones of data science teaching websites: Currently Data Carpentry and Software Carpentry
