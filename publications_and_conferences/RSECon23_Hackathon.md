## Ideas for a hackathon

* Mass testing, how many people can we get connected at once? Does a USB wifi dongle work better than a Pi's built in wifi? How well do laptops and other devices work for testing? Do our webpages work correctly on a range of operating systems and browsers?
* Practice lesson: run through a lesson (or at least some relevant parts of it) to test the web pages, gitea, etherpad, jupyter etc. 
* Bug fixing session: try to fix any outstanding bugs we have. 
* New feature implementation/exploration: What haven't we written yet that would be helpful? Screen sharing so we don't need a projector? Using laptops to host? Running surveys and forwarding the results to the Carpentries?
