Carpentries Offline: Running a Carpentries Workshop without the Internet

### Abstract

***Please enter an abstract of your talk, panel, workshop, walkthrough or poster (max 250 words)***

CarpentriesOffline (<https://carpentriesoffline.org>) is an out of the box solution for running a Carpentries workshop from a single device such as a Raspberry Pi, old laptop or even a dedicated server. It is intended for use in environments where there is limited or no internet access. Everything needed to run the workshop including course notes, data files, software downloads, a Git server, etherpad and a Jupyter Hub server are provided by the CarpentriesOffline system. It can also provide a backup environment for those with better connectivity in the event of the Carpentries website, etherpad, GitHub etc suffering an outage.

This poster will describe:

* The architecture of the CarpentriesOffline system
* The build process that automates the creation of OS images in GitHub Actions
* Ways to download and deploy it yourself
* How to get involved with the project

### Technical Plan

***If you are applying to lead a hackathon, workshop, or walkthrough, what technical requirements will you have? For example, will you be using Jupyter Notebooks, docker containers, virtual machines, etc? How will you specify your requirements for these (e.g. uploaded to dockerhub, scripts on GitHub, a list of packages to install etc.). You can put your initial plan here and refine it if you are accepted.***
