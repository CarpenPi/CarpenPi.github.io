## Title

### Running Carpentries Workshop offline with The Carpentries Offline

---
## Abstract 
Just over a year ago at the Software Sustainability Institute's Collaborations Workshop (SSI CW2021), a group discussed the challenge of delivering Carpentries Workshops in areas where there is no, limited, or intermittent Internet access. We took the problem forward to the Hackday which was the last day of CW2021 and won the first prize with our solution. A year later we are still working on the project and a member of our team even managed to be awarded an SSI fellowship to develop it further. The project was initially named CarpenPi but was changed to The Carpentries Offline. Our solution to this challenge is to use a Raspberry Pi computer to serve as an access point and a web server that provides access to all of the required software, packages, and lesson materials for each workshop.
