## Title

### Running Carpentries Workshop offline with The Carpentries Offline

---
## Abstract 
Just over a year ago at the Software Sustainability Institute's Collaborations Workshop (SSI CW2021), a group of us discussed the problem of delivering Carpentries Workshops in areas where there is no, limited or intermittent Internet access. We took the problem forward to the Hackday which was the last day of CW2021 and won the first prize with our solution. A year later we are still working on the project and a member of our team even managed to be awarded an SSI fellowship to develop it even further. The project started off being called CarpenPi but we decided to change the name to avoid any problems with trademarks and so we decided on The Carpentries Offline. The solution we proposed and are currently working on is to use a Raspberry Pi computer to serve as an access point and a web server.

In this workshop, we would like to have attendees gather in groups of two or three people and go through the workflow of creating a server, have learners connect to the server and deliver a workshop. Attendees will need to bring their own laptops and each group will be given a Raspberry Pi and a microSD card. The number of attendees allowed for the workshop will depend on the number of Raspberry Pis we can obtain but we hope for that to be about six which will allow 12 to 18 people to attend.
